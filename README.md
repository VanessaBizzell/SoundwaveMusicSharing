# Soundwave: Music Social Media App

Welcome to Soundwave, a music-sharing social media platform! This app allows users to upload their own music, share it with others, and engage with the community through comments and likes.

## About the Project

Soundwave is built using:
- **Frontend**: Angular framework with TypeScript.
- **Backend**: TypeScript/Express.
- **Database**: MongoDB.

This project is a learning exercise to explore Angular and TypeScript. It's my second Angular project and is currently a work in progress. Feedback is always welcome!

## Features

- **Music Uploads**: Users can upload their own tracks and share them with the community.
- **Engagement**: Support for comments and likes on music uploads.
- **Public Domain Library**: The app includes pre-uploaded music sourced from the [Open Music Archive](https://www.openmusicarchive.org/about.php).

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VanessaBizzell/SoundwaveMusicSharing.git

2. Install dependencies for the frontend and backend:

   # Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend
npm install

# Navigate to the backend directory
cd ../backend
npm install

3. Start the development server:
# In the frontend directory
ng serve

# In the backend directory
npm start


## Legal Disclaimer
Music already uploaded to the app is in the Public Domain (UK) and has been sourced from the Open Music Archive. Please do not upload music that you do not own the copyright to.

## Feedback
Iâ€™d love to hear your thoughts! I plan to continue improving this project - next sprints planned soon.

Thank you for checking out Soundwave! ðŸŽµ
